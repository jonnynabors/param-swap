# TODOS

## Implementation Stuff

- In the code, I'd like to see everything including and between the parentheses, afterwards we can do the following
- Must only run the extension between parentheses
  - Show an error to the user if they aren't in parentheses
- If no comma between parens, show an error
- If more than one comma exists, tell the user we only support single comma swaps

## Meta Level Stuff

- Unit tests w/ Jest
- Cool Icon
